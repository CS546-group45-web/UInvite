# UInvite
This is a web project for CS 546 Web programming Fall2022

# Description
This web app will provide a new approach to event rsvp. There are many apps that let users send rsvp invitations and nothing more that could make invitations and events more enticing. This application will act as a social media platform for people to post events and others to rsvp, obviously events could be set to only being visible to a certain group. This would not only make spreading news about events simpler and would also allow guests to comment on any concerns they have about the events. This application will hold the aspect of family and friends event planning at heart but social media features are a massive plus. This targets small event registrations but this could also spread to massive events planned by big companies as well.

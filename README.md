# UInvite
This is a web project for CS 546 Web programming Fall2022

# Description
U Invite, bridges the gap between event planning and social media, creating an experience reminiscent of Instagram, yet focused on event RSVPs.

This unique platform enables users to post their events on a shared or private feed, controlling visibility to match the event's intended audience. This not only streamlines the process of spreading news about events but also allows potential attendees to engage through comments and discussions, mirroring the interactive nature of popular social media platforms.

At its core, U Invite is a full-stack application, blending front-end usability with robust back-end functionality. It's designed to handle everything from small-scale, personal events to large, corporate gatherings. While the emphasis is on intimate event planning, the functionality scales effectively, providing a versatile tool for any event size.

With U Invite, we're revolutionizing the event planning process by integrating it with the dynamic, interactive features of social media, thereby enhancing the overall event experience."
